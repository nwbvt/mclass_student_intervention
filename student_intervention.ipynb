Unlike other algorithms which end up being black boxes which only make sense to a computer, a human being can look at the model and easily reason about how it is making decisions.  Unfortunately it is also often a victim of overfitting, and care must be taken to make sure it is not trusting the data too much.\n",
    "- While the white box nature of this model may not be an easily quantified, it could be very important in a situation like an educational environment.  It may be important to eaisily audit the decisions it is making for various legal reasons to make sure the decisions that are being made with it are fair to the kids involved.  Furthermore it is often going to be the case that *why* the student was classified the way they were will be more important to the educator than the actual classification.  Thus if this model can get acceptable results, it may be preferable even against models that perform slightly better.\n",

And while the models aren't as easy to interpret as decision trees, there are still techniques to get an idea of what they are doing (including the feature\\_importance\\_ property in sklearn's implementation.  A disadvantage of them is that they can be slow to train when using large numbers of trees. They also aren't particularly efficient when there are many classes that need to be predicted.\n",
    "- Because we are not using a particularly large data set (the largest school districts tend to number in the millions of students) and the training will be done offline, we can probably afford to spend some extra time in the training phase.

    "I'm proposing using Gradient Boosting for this project.  It got among the best F1 score, especially for smaller training sizes.  KNN did perform about as well, but Decision Trees performed fairly poorly until it got large training sizes.  And while it had the slowest training times, it had much quicker prediction times than KNN.  Since training can be done offline pretty easily (such as by running it overnight when the schools are closed) its not going to be as important as having acceptable scoring times which may need to be run on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "But perhaps the most important reason to choose it over KNN (the only other model that had as good F1 scores) is that it is not hard to interpret.  With a KNN model the best you can say is that a particular student was classified that way because they were similar to other students that had those results.  While this may be acceptable from a mathematical perspective, the educational sector tends to have to deal with more political \"complications\".  Due to this, a model where you can better visualize the process with regard to the features (and not the training data) may be critical.\n",
